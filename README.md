Tic-Tac-Toe AI
A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built for CS50, featuring an intelligent AI opponent. 
The project includes tictactoe.py, which handles game logic and optimal move calculations using minimax, and runner.py, which powers a graphical interface. 
Run python runner.py to challenge the AI on a 3x3 board represented as a list of lists with X, O, and EMPTY states. Test your skills against an unbeatable foe! ðŸŽ® #CS50
